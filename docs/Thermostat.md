Introducing the "my_thermo_stat" Function

The "my_thermo_stat" function is a smart thermostat controller, designed to automatically determine the optimal thermostat status based on the current temperature and desired temperature settings. This versatile function accepts two integer parameters—`temp` for the current temperature and `desired_temp` for the desired temperature—in degrees Fahrenheit.

Depending on the temperature differential between the current and desired settings, this function provides one of three thermostat statuses: 'Heat,' 'AC,' or 'Off.' It intelligently selects 'Heat' when the current temperature is significantly lower than the desired temperature, 'AC' when it's significantly higher, and 'Off' when the current temperature is within a 5-degree range of the desired temperature.

Whether you're managing climate control systems or simply curious about how thermostats work, this function offers an efficient and automated solution. Explore its functionality through the provided examples, demonstrating its ability to make informed decisions for a comfortable indoor environment.
