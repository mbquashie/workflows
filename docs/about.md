# Functions Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of five functions defined in the `area_and_perimeter.py` and `examples_functions.py` modules. These functions serve various purposes and are part of an in-class assignment. The assignment requires documenting each function's purpose, input parameters, output, authorship, and the date it was created. This is to be done using the Di√°taxis framework.
